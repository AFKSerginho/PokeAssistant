## Troubleshooting
### Bot is not coming offline, (no web tab or web tab exists but says `Hmmmmm... We cannot reach...`)
Make sure Secrets in Environment Variables are correct! The Key `CHANNEL` must be Uppercase. Ex. `CHANNEL`. If that doesn't work, clear your index.js file and paste [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/main/src/index.js) code. Also, clear your package.json file and paste [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/main/src/package.json) code. Press **Run** again.
### Bot is not coming online, (web says `I am alive`)
